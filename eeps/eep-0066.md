EEP 66: Sigils for String Literals
----

Abstract
========

This EEP proposes Sigils for string literals very much like
[Elixir Sigils][1].  The chief reason is to facilitate other suggested
language features,  many of which exists in Elixir under the umbrella of
[Sigils][1], such as:

* Binary Strings: `unicode:unicode_binary()`
* Regular Expression Syntax
* Choice of string delimiters
* Verbatim Strings
* [String Interpolation Syntax][2], or Variable Interpolation

Rationale
=========

Many existing suggestions about features in the [Abstract][]
use a prefix before a normal erlang string such as:

    u"For UTF-8 encoded binary strings"

or

    bf"For UTF-8 encoded binary with interpolation formatting: ~foo()~"

This EEP suggests using the same or very similar syntax as in Elixir
for [Sigils][3] on literal strings to avoid syntactical problems with
simple prefixes, and to not make these sibling languages deviate
too much without good reason:

    ~"For UTF-8 encoded binary strings"

Design Decisions
----------------

In the following text double angle quotation marks are used to
mark source code characters in a paragraph.  For example:
«`.`» means the dot character (full stop).

### Erlang Language Structure (Tokenizer and Parser)

The Erlang programming language is built according to a traditional
tokenizer+parser+compiler model.

The tokenizer a.k.a. scanner a.k.a. lexer scans the source code
character sequence and converts it into a sequence of Tokens,
like atom, variable, string, integer, reserved word,
punctuation character or operator:
«`atom`», «`Variable`», «`"string"`», «`123`», «*case*», «`:`» and «`++`».

The parser takes a sequence of tokens and builds a parse tree,
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), according to the Erlang grammar.
This AST is then what the compiler compiles into executable
(virtual machine) code.

#### The Tokenizer

The tokenizer is simple.  It stems from the tool *lex*
that try a set of regular expressions on the input and when one
matches it becomes a token and is removed from the input.
Rinse and repeat.

The tokenizer is no longer that simple, but it doesn't keep
much state and looks just a few fixed number of characters ahead
in the input.

For example; from the start state, if the tokenizer sees
a «`'`» character, it switches state to scanning a quoted atom.
While doing so it translates escape sequences such as «`\n`»
(into ASCII 10) and when it sees a «`'`» character it produces
an atom token and goes back to the start state.

### Problems with simple prefixes

All of these simple prefixes have to become separate tokens in the tokenizer:
«`bf"`» would constitute the start token for a binary string
with interpolation syntax.  So would «`bf"""`», «`b"`», «`b"""`»,
and so on.

The tokenizer would have to know of all combinations of prefix characters
and emit distinct tokens for every combination.

Today, the character sequence «`b`», «`f`», «`"`» is scanned as a token
for the atom «`bf`» followed by the string start token «`"`».
That combination fails in the parser so it is syntactically invalid today,
which is what makes simple prefixes a possible language extension.

A simple prefix approach would have to scan a number of characters
ahead to distinguish between an atom followed by string start
vs. prefixed string start, and it would be a different number
of characters depending on which atom characters that have
been found so far.  This is rather messy.

Furthermore, it is likely that we want the feature of choosing
[String Delimiters][], especially for regular expressions such as:

    re(^"+.*/.*$)

Among the desired delimiters are «`/`» and «`<`»+«`>`».  The currently
valid code «`b<X`» meaning atom «`b`» less than «`X`», would instead
have to be interpreted as prefixed string start «`b<`» with «`X`»
being the first string content character.

For the «`/`» character we run into similar problems with for example
«`b/X`», which would be a run-time error today, but if we also would
want capital letter prefixes, then «`B/X`» is perfectly valid today
but would become a string start.

There are more likely problems with simple string prefixes:
«`#bf{`» is today the start of a record named «`bf`», and is
scanned as punctuation character «`#`», atom «`bf`» and separator «`{`»,
which the parser sorts out to be a record start.

With simple prefix characters the tokenizer would have to be rewritten
to recognize «`#bf`» as a new record token, a rewrite that might cause
unexpected changes in record handling.  For example, today, «`# bf {`»
is also a valid record start, so to be completely compatible the tokenizer
would have to allow white-space or even newlines within the new record
token, between «`#`» and the atom characters, which would be really ugly...

For other reasons, namely that function call parenthesis are optional,
Elixir has chosen to use the «`~`» character as the start of
a string prefix which they call a "[Sigil][1]".

Having a distinct start character for this feature simplifies
tokenizing and parsing.

### Sigil

In a general sense, a [Sigil][3], is a prefix to a variable
that indicates its type, such as «`$I`» in Basic or Perl,
where «`$`» is the sigil and «`I`» is the variable.

Here we define a Sigil as a prefix (and a suffix) to a string literal
that indicates how it should be interpreted.  The Sigil is
a syntactic sugar that creates some Erlang term.

A Sigil string literal consists of:

1. The Sigil start character «`~`».
2. The [Sigil Type][], a name that may be empty.
3. The [String Content][] within [String Delimiters][].
4. The [Sigil Suffix][], a name character sequence that may be empty.

### Sigil Type

Immediately following the [Sigil][] start character is the Sigil Type
which is a name composed of a sequence of characters that are allowed
as the second or later characters in a variable or an atom.
In short ISO [Latin-1][] letters, digits, «`_`» and «`@`».
The [Sigil Type][] may be empty.

The Sigil Type defines how the [Sigil][] syntactic sugar
shall be interpreted.  The suggested Sigil Types are:

* «»: the Vanilla [Sigil][].

  Creates an Erlang `unicode:unicode_binary()`.
  It is a string represented as a UTF-8 encoded binary,
  equivalent to applying `unicode:characters_to_binary/1`
  on the [String Content][].  The [String Delimiters][]
  and escape characters work as for regular strings,
  triple-quoted strings, or quoted atoms in Erlang.

  So «`~"abc\d"`» is equivalent to «`<<"abc\d"/utf8>>`», and
  «`~'abc"d'`» is equivalent to «`<<"abc\"d"/utf8>>`».

  «`~"`» would work as «`~s"`» and «`~"""`» would work
  as «`~S"""`» below, regarding escape characters.

  A simple way to create strings as UTF-8 binaries is supposedly
  the first and most desired missing string feature in Erlang.
  This sigil does just that and has no other features.

* «`s`»: [string in Elixir][4].

  Creates an Erlang `unicode:unicode_binary()`, handling
  escape characters in the string content.  How other features
  like string interpolation would work is still an open question.

  Escape characters and other features are the same regardless
  of which [String Delimiters][] that are used.

* «`S`»: [string in Elixir][4], verbatim.

  Creates an Erlang `unicode:unicode_binary()`, with verbatim
  string content in that only the [end delimiter][] character
  can be escaped with a «`\`» character.

  Which [String Delimiters][] that are used does not matter,
  except that between triple-quote delimiters according to
  [EEP 64][] there is no end delimiter character to escape.

* «`c`»: [charlist in Elixir][4].

  Creates an Erlang `string()`, handling escape characters
  in the string content.  How other features like
  string interpolation would work is still an open question.

  Escape characters and other features are the same regardless
  of which [String Delimiters][] that are used.

* «`C`»: [charlist in Elixir][4], verbatim.

  Creates an Erlang `string()`, with verbatim string content
  in that only the [end delimiter][] character can be escaped
  with a «`\`» character.

  Which [String Delimiters][] that are used does not matter,
  except that between triple-quote delimiters according to
  [EEP 64][] there is no end delimiter character to escape.

* «`r`»: regular expression.

  Creates a term `{re,RE::unicode:charlist(),Flags::[unicode:latin1_char()]}`
  that is an uncompiled regular expression with compile flags,
  suitable for (yet to be implemented) functions in the `re` module.
  The `RE` element is the [String Content][], and the `Flags` element
  is the [Sigil Suffix][].

  See the [Regular Expressions][] section about the reasoning
  behind this proposed term type.

  Within the [String Content][], character escape sequences are handled
  according to the regular expression rules, and in addition to them
  the [end delimiter][] character can be escaped with a «`\`» character.
  Between triple-quote delimiters according to [EEP 64][]
  there is no end delimiter character to escape.

  The main advantage of a regular expression [Sigil][] is to avoid
  the additional escaping of «`\`» that regular erlang strings add.

  Today: `re:run(Subject, "^\\s*\"[a-z]+\\\\\\d+\"", [caseless,unicode])`

  Sigil: `re:run(Subject, ~r'^\s*"[a-z]+\\\d+"'iu)`

  Other advantages are possible tools and library integration features
  such as making the `re` module recognize this tuple format,
  and having the code loader pre-compile them.

### String Delimiters

Immediately following the [Sigil Type][] is the string start delimiter.
A specific start delimiter character has a corresponding
end delimiter character.

These are the start delimiter characters and they have themselves
as end delimiter: single quote «`'`» and double quote «`"`».

Triple-quote delimiters are also allowed, that is; a sequence of
3 or more double quote «`"`» characters as described in [EEP 64][].

### String Content

Between the start and end [String Delimiters][], all characters
are string content.

In a triple-quoted string all characters are verbatim, but stripping
of indentation and leading and trailing newline is done as usual
as described in [EEP 64][].

In a string with single character [String Delimiters][],
normal Erlang escape sequences prefixed with «`\`» are honoured,
as usual for regular Erlang strings and quoted atoms

A specific [Sigil Type][] can have it's own character escaping rules,
which may affect finding the [end delimiter][].

### Sigil Suffix

Immediately following the String Content comes the Sigil Suffix,
which may be empty.

The Sigil Suffix consists, as the [Sigil Type][] in the [Sigil][] prefix,
of name characters.

The Sigil Suffix may indicate how to interpret the String Content,
for a specific [Sigil Type][].  For example; for the «`~r`» [Sigil][]
(regular expression), the Sigil Suffix is interpreted as short form
compile options such as «`i`» that makes the regular expression
character case insensitive.

Things that may have to be performed by the tokenizer, such as
how to handle escape character rules, should not be affected
by the Sigil Suffix, since the tokenizer has already scanned
the [String Content][] when it sees the Sigil Suffix.

### Regular Expressions

A regular expression sigil «`~r"expression"flags`» should
be translated to something useful for tools/libraries.
There are at least two ways; [uncompiled regular expressions][],
or [compiled regular expressions][].

#### Uncompiled Regular Expression

The value of a regular expression [Sigil][] is chosen
to be a tuple `{re,RE,Flags}`.

With this representation, the `re` module can be augmented
with functions that accept this tuple format that bundles
a regular expression with compile flags.  These functions
are `re:compile/1,2`, `re:replace/3,4` `re:run/2,3`,
and `re:split/2,3`.  Translation of the `Flags`' characters
into `re:compile_option()`s should be done by these functions.

Example of calling a yet to be implemented `re:run/3`:

    1> re:run("ABC123", ~r"abc\d+"i, [{capture,first,list}]).
    {match,["ABC123"]}

Since the [Sigil][] value represents an uncompiled regular expression,
the user can choose when to compile it with `re:compile/1,2`,
or use it directly in for example `re:run/2,3`.

It is possible to implement an optimization to make the compiler
aware that when passing a regular expression [Sigil][],
which is a literal, to functions like `re:run/2,3`, code can be emitted
for the code loader (a now missing feature) to compile
the regular expression at load time and instead pass
the pre-compiled regular expression to `re:run/2,3`.

For this optimization to be safe, other compile options than the ones
in the [Sigil][] value cannot be allowed to affect for example `re:run/3`
that has options as the third argument.  If `re:run/3` would fail
for any compile options (only allow run-time options), or if
the options argument is a literal to be included in
pre-compilation, then such an optimization is safe.

#### Compiled Regular Expression

Another possibility would be that the value of a regular expression
[Sigil][] is a compiled regular expression; the `re:mp()` type.

Then it can be used as above, *except* as an argument to
`re:compile/1,2`.  Pre-compilation would be a hard requirement
since the running Erlang code *must* see a compiled regular expression.

And we would still have to decide on another sigil type to be used
in `re:compile/1,2` that is syntactic sugar for an *uncompiled*
regular expression.  Without that a `~S` sigil could be used
but that won't have the compile flags as suffix so those flags
cannot be given in the same way for compiled vs. uncompiled
regular expressions.

#### Therefore Uncompiled

Since we in any case need a [Sigil][] that is syntactic sugar for
an uncompiled regular expression, and pre-compilation optimization
is possible with that, this EEP suggests that a regular expression Sigil
should represent an *uncompiled* regular expression with compile flags.

### Comparison with Elixir

An empty [Sigil Type][] is not allowed in Elixir.

When Elixir allows escape sequences in the [String Content][]
it also allows string interpolation.  This EEP avoids the topic
of string interpolation.

There are small differences in which escape sequences that are implemented
in the languages; Elixir allows escaping of newlines, and has
an escape sequence «`\a`», that Erlang does not have.

There are also small differences in how newlines are handled
between «`~S`» heredocs in Elixir and triple-quoted strings in Erlang.
See [EEP 64][].

Adding the [Vanilla Sigil][], «`~`» to an Erlang regular string
or triple-quoted string creates a UTF-8 encoded binary equivalent
to the corresponding [Elixir][1] string or «`~S`» heredoc.

Details about regular expression sigils, «`~r`», in particular
their [Sigil Suffix][]es remains to be decided in Erlang.

It has not been decided how or even *if* string interpolation
in will be implemented in Erlang, but a [Sigil Suffix][] or
a [Sigil Type][] would most probably be used.

Reference Implementation
------------------------

[PR-7684][] Implements the basics of handling Sigils on string literals.
The tokenizer produces a «`sigil`» token before the string literal, and a
«`sigil_suffix`» token after.  These are then removed by the parser.

Another approach would be to produce (for example) a «`sigil_string`» token
for the whole string and then handle that in the parser.
It would require more state to be kept in the tokenizer between
the parts of the sigil prefixed string, and therefore need
more tokenizer rewriting.
