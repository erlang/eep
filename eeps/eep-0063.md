EEP 63: Lightweight UTF-8 binary string literals and patterns
----

Abstract
========

This EEP proposes new syntax for UTF-8 binary string literals and patterns to bring them
into line with list-strings.

List-strings (i.e. strings represented by lists of unicode codepoints) have a
convenient syntax: `"This is my string"`, but the corresponding syntax for
UTF-8 encoded binary strings is more cumbersome: `<<"This is my string"/utf8>>`.

Here, we propose a lightweight, alternative syntax for UTF-8 binary string literals:

```
Str = b"This is my string".
```

and patterns:

```
case Str of
  b"This is my string" -> ok;
  _ -> error
end.
```

Implementation outline
==============

Early during compilation and shell evaluation, the new syntax would be desugared to
the corresponding existing syntax, e.g. `b"This is my string"` is rewritten to
`<<"This is my string"/utf8>>`.

Reference Implementation
========

TBD

Backward compatibility
========

The new syntax is invalid in older releases, so would not impact existing code.

The implementation of the new syntax would purely be via an early re-writing step,
so would be desugared to the existing representation before later compiler stages.
This would mean bytecode would be unaffected, but debugging/AST data would reflect
the new source represenation.
