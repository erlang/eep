EEP 61: Built-in dynamic type
----

Abstract
========

This EEP proposes a new built-in type `dynamic()` (in addition to existing
built-in type `term()`) to make Erlang friendly to gradual type checking.
Having a special dynamic type for gradual typing is a widely adopted industrial
solution.

Gradual typing and dynamic type
========

Erlang is one of many programming languages which started as pure dynamically
typed languages with no static type information but then got extensions
(or dialects) to specify type information (type hints, specs) in source code.

Erlang got extended with specs through
[EEP 8](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0008)
(Types and function specifications).

The current documentation for types and specs can be found at
<https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html>.

Beyond being used for documentation purposes, types and specs can be used by
tooling for static analysis. The existing tools include:

- [dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html)
- [eqWAlizer](https://github.com/whatsapp/eqwalizer)
- [Gradualizer](https://github.com/josefs/Gradualizer) and its Elixir frontend
  [Gradient](https://github.com/esl/gradient)

Dialyzer uses type specs in the paradigm of success typing (documented in
[Pull Request 6281](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/6281) "Document
the meaning of specs" and in the original
[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1292520.1292523) "A language
for specifying type contracts in Erlang and its interaction
with success typings"). It is worth to note that dialyzer handles specs
very differently from traditional type checkers.

eqWAlizer uses type specs to perform type checking in a traditional manner.

As of now, the main industrial approach to adopt or retrofit static typing
to dynamically typed languages is through gradual typing
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>,
<http://samth.github.io/gradual-typing-bib>).
Gradual typing features a special type `dynamic` or `?`, which allows to mix
untyped (or dynamically typed) and statically typed code in a user-friendly
manner and also helps adopt static typing incrementally in large projects.
Having a special dynamic type for gradual typing is a widely adopted solution.

Since Erlang doesn't have a built-in dynamic type in the surface syntax,
eqWAlizer had to introduce its own type `eqwalizer:dynamic()` with special
semantics for the purposes of gradual typing.

`term()`/`any()` and subtyping through examples
========

Before starting discussing the dynamic type, it is worth to clarify
the meaning and semantics of the built-in Erlang types `term()` and `any()`.

- `any()` is the top type element of the subtyping lattice.
  This is clearly stated in Erlang
  [documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html)
- `term()` is an alias to `any()`. They are the same types.
  In the rest of the document we would use `term()` as it's more
  Erlang-specific.

The type `term()` is similar to the following types in other languages
and type-checkers:

- [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object) in
  Python (see also the details about object in the
  [typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#the-any-type)).
  [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/),
  [PyRight](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
  [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) handle `object` the same way.
- [`unknown`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#unknown)
  in Typescript
- `top` in Ruby 3 rbs (<https://github.com/ruby/rbs/blob/master/docs/syntax.md>)
- [`unknown`](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck#unknown-type) in luau
- [`mixed`](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/built-in-types/mixed) in Hack
- [`mixed`](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/mixed/) in Flow

Using `term()` value where a more concrete type is expected is a type error
from the point of view of traditional static typing.

Let's take a look at the examples.

Example 1. Erlang, eqWAlizer:

    -module(example).

    -spec foo(term()) -> number().
    foo(N) ->
        N.
        ^ % type error. expected: number(), got: term()

    -spec n(number()) -> number().
    n(N) -> N.

    -spec foo_n(term()) -> number().
    foo_n(N) ->
        n(N).
          ^ type error. expected: number(), got term()

Example 2. Python, mypy:

    def foo(n: object) -> int:
        return n
               ~ Incompatible return value type (got "object", expected "int")

    def n_fun(n: int) -> int:
        return n

    def foo_n(n: object) -> int:
        return n_fun(n)
                     ~ Argument 1 to "n_fun" has incompatible type "object";
                                                  expected "int"  [arg-type]

Example 3. TypeScript:

    function foo(x: unknown): number {
        return x;
        ~~~~~~~~~ Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'.(2322)
    }

    function n_fun(n: number): number {
        return n;
    }

    function foo_n(n: unknown): number {
        return n_fun(n);
                     ~ Argument of type 'unknown' is not assignable
                                      to parameter of type 'number'
    }

`dynamic()` type
========

eqWAlizer has a special type `eqwalizer:dynamic()` which is documented
[here](https://github.com/WhatsApp/eqwalizer/blob/main/docs/reference/modes.md#type-eqwalizerdynamic).

The type is similar to the following types in other languages and type-checkers:

- [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#the-any-type) in Python (mypy, PyRight, pyre handle it the same way)
- [any](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#any) in TypeScript
- [untyped](https://github.com/ruby/rbs/blob/master/docs/syntax.md) in Ruby/rbs
- [untyped](https://sorbet.org/docs/untyped) in Ruby/Sorbet
- [any](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck#any-type) in luau
- [dynamic](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/built-in-types/dynamic) in Hack
- [any](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/any/) in Flow

eqWAlizer borrowed the name from Hack.
The naming choice was dictated by the following considerations:

- `eqwalizer:any()` would misleading and confusion because of the built-in
  Erlang type `any()`
- `eqwalizer:dynamic()` is often used to mark "inherently dynamic code":
  reading from ETS, message passing, deserialization and so on.

(In the rest of the document we use just `dynamic()` as an abbreviation for
`eqwalizer:dynamic()`.)

The rationale for introducing `dynamic()` type is given in eqWAlizer
[documentation](https://github.com/WhatsApp/eqwalizer/blob/main/docs/reference/modes.md#type-eqwalizerdynamic)
and in the already mentioned resources for other languages and type checkers.

We propose to extend Erlang surface syntax with new `dynamic()` built-in type
to make Erlang more friendly to tooling built on ideas of gradual typing
(like eqWAlizer or Gradualizer) and ease its adoption
(including using it for typing OTP libraries).

Can it be just one type?
========

One may argue that just one type - `term()`/`any()` may be enough, and it's up
to tooling to interpret it as a proper top type or as a special dynamic type
for gradual typing. This, however, would be limiting in the long run.

The stories of other similar languages and type checkers exhibit a commonality:
they all ended up in having options or modes for different levels of strictness
and guarantees.  Or, roughly speaking - they have at least two modes:
gradual mode and strict mode. Gradual mode is optimised for a non-intrusive
incremental adoption while strict mode is optimised for type safety
and strong sound guarantees.

- In large enough projects there appear places with strict typing and places
  with "mostly dynamic typing".
- Differentiating between `term()` and `dynamic()` without introducing
  ambiguity or confusion becomes important.
- The language of types is not always expressive enough to write down precise
  types. In this case `dynamic()` type works as an escape hatch.
- In some mission-critical applications where correctness is of most
  importance, one may want to use `term()` type with verbose checks/guards
  to make sure that nothing escapes type-checking.
- Using only `term()`/`any()` has also proven problematic, in practice, in
  [the development of Gradualizer](https://github.com/josefs/Gradualizer/pull/244).
  Originally, Gradualizer repurposed `any()` for the dynamic type and used
  `term()` as the top type.
  According to the Gradualizer's authors it turned out to be confusing
  and incompatible with the pre-existing use of these types.

What does this mean for dialyzer?
========

Internally, dialyzer already uses `any()`/`term()` as `dynamic()`
with respect to specs.

An example:

    -module(example).
    -export([get_foo/1, get_bar/1, get_moo/1]).

    -record(rec, {
      foo :: term() | atom(),
      bar :: number() | atom(),
      moo :: term()
    }).

    -spec get_foo(#rec{}) -> number().
    get_foo(R) -> R#rec.foo.

    -spec get_bar(#rec{}) -> number().
    get_bar(R) -> R#rec.bar.

    -spec get_moo(#rec{}) -> number().
    get_moo(R) -> R#rec.moo.

Running dialyzer (`dialyzer example.erl`) produces the output:

    example.erl:14:2: The success typing for example:get_bar/1 implies
                      that the function might also return atom()
                      but the specification return is number()

As for `eqwalizer:dynamic()` - it's
[defined](https://github.com/WhatsApp/eqwalizer/blob/53b791858cc4c1b1f462803a88ab9151f5cc2925/eqwalizer_support/src/eqwalizer.erl#L21)
as an alias to `any()`/`term()` and can be used together with dialyzer.
(However, defining it this way creates confusion for pedantic and curious
users.)
